Overview
In this project, I created a Power BI dashboard that transforms raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards. The dashboard is designed to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. The process involved several key steps, outlined below.

Steps Performed
1. Connecting & Shaping Data
Extracted, cleaned, transformed, and loaded project data using Power Query.
2. Creating a Relational Data Model
Reviewed data modeling best practices.
Introduced concepts like cardinality, normalization, filter flow, and star schemas.
Built the AdventureWorks data model from the ground up.
3. Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
Created calculated columns and measures using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
4. Visualizing Data with Reports
Brought data to life with reports and dashboards.
Reviewed data visualization best practices.
Built and formatted basic charts.
Added interactivity with bookmarks and slicer panels.
