The Brief

AdventureWorks is a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories. The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. The only data provided was a folder of raw CSV files, which contain information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.

What I Learned

Data Preparation: The data was provided in CSV files for customers, product categories, territory data, sales data, and returns. I checked and cleaned the data for duplicates and errors.

Transformations: Performed transformations to create calculated columns and measures using common functions and formulas.

Data Modeling: Built a relational data model, creating active relationships between tables and understanding cardinality and filter flow.

Dashboard Design: Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize data using various charts and visuals, including KPI cards, matrices, slicers, bar charts, line and clustered column charts, gauges, and maps.

Interactivity: Added bookmarks, drill-through filters, and page-level and report-level filters to enhance interactivity.
